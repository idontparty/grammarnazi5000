# grammarnazi5000
State of the art grammar nazi bot for Slack


### Introduction
The NewbieCorner of 14.08.2016 forced us to create an awesome slackbot. I
simply forgot to put the 'awesome' in my bot. Regardless this is the
introduction for `grammarnazi5000`, a state of the art grammar nazi bot for
Slack. It is basically a creepy stalker you add to your channel and it bothers
you with making fun of your stupid spelling mistakes..


### Requirements
+ python2.7
+ virtualenv
+ Access to a slack thingy
+ pip
+ Obviously this software


### Installation
+ Create a slack bot (on the web interface for your slack channel)
+ Create a virtualenvironment: `virtualenv venv` in the grammarnazi5000 folder
+ Change into the new environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
+ Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
+ Edit your `config_template.py` file to your likings, then rename: `mv
  config_template.py config.py`
+ Run: `python grammarnazi5000.py`
+ Profit!


### Future plans
Not really. BUT if you're keen to work on it, feel free to do so, please just
give me some credz. Get in touch if you have some hilarious ideas for this el8 bot.


### Feelings
Not really that proud....
